      I am in municipal politics because decisions today secure better
      opportunities for tomorrow.

      Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time, but solving it also
      offers a tremendous opportunity&#58; we can simultaneously build a city that
      is more pleasant, safer, and a better place to live.

      I want Espoo to be a city where climate actions improve the quality of life
      for residents. A city where mobility is easy and housing is affordable. A
      city where sustainable choices are attractive and accessible to everyone –
      regardless of income level or place of residence.

  translation: <p class="lead"><span class="fw-bold">Engineer and data
      scientist</span>
        with the ability to understand complex problems and develop practical
        solutions. In my work – and in life in general – I seek solutions to
        complex problems and combine different perspectives into practical
        actions.</p>
      <p class="lead"><span class="fw-bold">Born and raised in
      Espoo&#58;</span>
        I have lived my entire life in Espoo. I grew up in Mankkaa in a
        bilingual family and have now lived in Tapiola for 10 years. I love our
        city and know its challenges and opportunities.</p>
      <p class="lead"><span class="fw-bold">Active volunteer in
      organizations&#58;</span>
        I am involved in a lot. My years in the Aalto University Student Union
        representative council and Teknologföreningen taught me how to build
        communities and influence matters effectively. As a bilingual
        candidate, I also build bridges between different cultures and language
        groups in everyday life.</p>
      <p class="lead"><span class="fw-bold">Living by my values&#58;</span>
        Cycling and walking, favoring vegan food, and sustainable consumption
        are climate actions in my daily life.</p>
      <p class="lead"><span class="fw-bold">As a counterbalance to knowledge
      work</span>
        I love woodworking, singing in a choir, and diverse sports such as
        cycling, badminton, and the gym.</p>
