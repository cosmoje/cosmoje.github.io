Engineer and data scientist with the ability to understand complex problems and develop practical solutions. In my work – and in life in general – I seek solutions to complex problems and combine different perspectives into practical actions.

Born and raised in Espoo: I have lived my entire life in Espoo. I grew up in Mankkaa in a bilingual family and have now lived in Tapiola for 10 years. I love our city and know its challenges and opportunities.

Active volunteer in organizations: I am involved in a lot. My years in the Aalto University Student Union representative council and Teknologföreningen taught me how to build communities and influence matters effectively. As a bilingual candidate, I also build bridges between different cultures and language groups in everyday life.

Living by my values: Cycling and walking, favoring vegan food, and sustainable consumption are climate actions in my daily life.

As a counterbalance to knowledge work I love woodworking, singing in a choir, and diverse sports such as cycling, badminton, and the gym.
