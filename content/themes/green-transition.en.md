# Green transition

By investing in the green transition and education, we can create a more sustainable and vibrant city while also creating new jobs.

The green transition also means making green choices easier:

* emphasizing sustainability even more in all procurements and tenders
* supporting companies that operate responsibly
* developing public transport and cycling and walking opportunities so that they feel like the most natural forms of movement
* supporting sustainable options, for example, by making vegetarian food the default option in the city’s food production.
