# A human-centered city

Residents create the city and community, and people should always be at the center of urban planning and construction. Espoo needs more multi-functional residential areas that promote community, where everyday services are within walking or cycling distance, and public transport works efficiently.

Let’s create neighborhoods together where everyday life flows smoothly, and people connect. Because our Espoo is a community, not just a collection of buildings and roads.

##### Walkable neighborhoods make everyday life easier
When workplaces, homes, and services are nearby, walking and cycling become natural choices. The city also remains human-sized when it is designed with people’s needs in mind.

##### Zoning for life
Ideally, a resident should be able to live their entire life in the same city area. Let’s build for all life stages and needs: apartment buildings, student housing, family homes, and detached houses, happily mixed. Housing remains affordable with sufficient housing production, but it’s also important to zone for both rental and owner-occupied housing, as well as market-priced and affordable housing in all areas.

##### Preserving local nature
Let’s build densely along good connections and more sparsely elsewhere. This way, nearby forests, coastal cliffs, and meadows won’t be covered by buildings but will remain for nature itself and for people’s recreation.

##### Involving residents in area planning
Zoning should be participatory and promote local democracy. Residents’ voices should be heard in area planning, and improvements should happen in consensus. As part of participatory budgeting, funds should also be directed to area development: residents can decide on their use themselves through direct democracy.
